## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- Aspose.Words for .NET library installed on your system.
- A valid license file for Aspose.Words. If you don't have one, you can obtain it from the Aspose website.

## Step 1: Import the Required Namespaces
To start, import the necessary namespaces in your C# code. These namespaces contain the classes and methods needed for working with Aspose.Words.

```csharp
using Aspose.Words;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 2: Initialize the License Object
Next, initialize the License object, which will be used to set the license for Aspose.Words. Add the following code:

```csharp
License license = new License();
```

## Step 3: Set the License from Stream
To set the license from a stream, use the SetLicense method of the License object. Create a MemoryStream from the license file and pass it as a parameter to the SetLicense method.

```csharp
try
{
    using (MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream(File.ReadAllBytes("Aspose.Words.lic")))
    {
        license.SetLicense(stream);
        Console.WriteLine("License set successfully.");
    }
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("\nThere was an error setting the license: " + e.Message);
}
```
