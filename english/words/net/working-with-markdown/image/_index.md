In this example, we will explain how to use the image feature with Aspose.Words for .NET. Pictures allow you to insert illustrations and graphics into a document.

## Step 1: Using a document generator

First, we'll use a document generator to add content to our document.

```csharp
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();
```

## Step 2: Inserting an image

We can insert an image using the `Shape` class and specifying the type of image, here `ShapeType.Image`. We also set the wrap type of the image to `WrapType.Inline`.

```csharp
Shape shape = new Shape(builder.Document, ShapeType.Image);
shape. WrapType = WrapType. Inline;
```

## Step 3: Image Customization

We customize the image by specifying its full path, for example `"/attachment/1456/pic001.png"`, and adding a title to the image.

```csharp
shape.ImageData.SourceFullName = "/attachment/1456/pic001.png";
shape.ImageData.Title = "Title";
```

### Example source code for images with Aspose.Words for .NET

```csharp
	// Use a document builder to add content to the document.
	DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();

	// Insert image.
	Shape shape = new Shape(builder.Document, ShapeType.Image);
	shape.WrapType = WrapType.Inline;
	shape.ImageData.SourceFullName = "/attachment/1456/pic001.png";
	shape.ImageData.Title = "title";
	builder.InsertNode(shape);
            
```
