In this step by step guide, we are going to tell you how to get the types of revisions in a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET. We'll provide you with the complete source code and show you how to format the markdown output.

## Step 1: Loading the document

The first step is to upload the document containing the revisions.

Next, we'll go through the paragraphs of the document and check the types of revisions associated with each paragraph.

```csharp
ParagraphCollection paragraphs = doc.FirstSection.Body.Paragraphs;
for (int i = 0; i < paragraphs.Count; i++)
{
     if (paragraphs[i].IsMoveFromRevision)
         Console.WriteLine("Paragraph {0} has been moved (deleted).", i);
     if (paragraphs[i].IsMoveToRevision)
         Console.WriteLine("Paragraph {0} has been moved (inserted).", i);
}
```
