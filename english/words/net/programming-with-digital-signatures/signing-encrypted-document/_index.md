In this tutorial, we will guide you through the steps to use the feature of signing an encrypted document with Aspose.Words for .NET. This feature allows you to digitally sign a Word document that is encrypted using a decryption password. Follow the steps below:

## Step 1: Setting Signature Options

Create an instance of the SignOptions class and set the decryption password:

SignOptions signOptions = new SignOptions { DecryptionPassword = "decryptionpassword" };
```

Be sure to specify the correct decryption password for your encrypted document.

## Step 2: Loading the certificate

```

Be sure to specify the correct path to your certificate and associated password.

## Step 3: Signing the encrypted document

Use the DigitalSignatureUtil class to sign the encrypted document:

```csharp
DigitalSignatureUtil.Sign(dataDir + "Digitally signed.docx", dataDir + "Document.EncryptedDocument.docx",
	certHolder, signOptions);
```

Be sure to specify the correct paths for the encrypted document, signed document, and certificate.
