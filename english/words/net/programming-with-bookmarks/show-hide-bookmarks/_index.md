## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of the C# language.

Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Bookmarks.docx");
```

We use the `ShowHideBookmarkedContent` function to show or hide a specific bookmark in the document. This function takes as parameters the document, the name of the bookmark and a boolean to indicate whether to show or hide the bookmark:

```csharp
ShowHideBookmarkedContent(doc, "MyBookmark1", false);
```

## Step 3: Saving the modified document

We use the `Save` method to save the modified document to a file:

doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithBookmarks.ShowHideBookmarks.docx");
```
