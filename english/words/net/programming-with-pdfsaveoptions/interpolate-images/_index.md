This article provides a step by step guide on how to use the image interpolation feature with Aspose.Words for .NET. We will explain each part of the code in detail. At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to understand how to enable image interpolation when converting to PDF.

Before you start, make sure you have installed and configured the Aspose.Words for .NET library in your project. You can find the library and installation instructions on the Aspose website.

## Step 1: Define the document directory

To start, you need to define the path to the directory where your documents are located. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your documents directory.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Upload the document

Next, we need to load the document we want to process. In this example, we assume the document is called "Rendering.docx" and is located in the specified documents directory.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
```

## Step 3: Configure options for saving as PDF with frame interpolation

To enable interpolation of images when converting to PDF, we need to configure the `PdfSaveOptions` object by setting the `InterpolateImages` property to `true`.

```csharp
PdfSaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions { InterpolateImages = true };
```

## Step 4: Save the document as a PDF with frame interpolation

Finally, we can save the document in PDF format using the save options configured previously.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithPdfSaveOptions.InterpolateImages.pdf", saveOptions);
```

That's all ! You have successfully enabled image interpolation while converting a document to PDF using Aspose.Words for .NET.

### Example source code for image interpolation with Aspose.Words for .NET


```csharp

	// The path to the documents directory.
