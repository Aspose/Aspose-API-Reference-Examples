This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the Export Document Structure feature with Aspose.Words for .NET. We will explain each part of the code in detail. At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to understand how to export the structure of a document and generate a PDF with the structure of the document visible.

Before you start, make sure you have installed and configured the Aspose.Words for .NET library in your project. You can find the library and installation instructions on the Aspose website.

## Step 1: Define the document directory

To start, you need to define the path to the directory where your documents are located. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your documents directory.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Upload the document

Next, we need to load the document we want to process. In this example, we assume the document is called "Paragraphs.docx" and is located in the specified documents directory.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Paragraphs.docx");
```

## Step 3: Configure save as PDF options

To export the document structure and make the structure visible in Adobe Acrobat Pro's "Content" navigation pane while editing the PDF file, we need to configure the `PdfSaveOptions` object with the `ExportDocumentStructure` property set to `true`.

```csharp
PdfSaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions { ExportDocumentStructure = true };
```

## Step 4: Save the document as a PDF with the document structure

Finally, we can save the document in PDF format using the save options configured previously.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithPdfSaveOptions.ExportDocumentStructure.pdf", saveOptions);
```

That's all ! You have successfully exported a document structure and generated a PDF with the document structure visible using Aspose.Words for .NET.

### Sample source code for exporting document structure with Aspose.Words for .NET

            // The file size will be increased and the structure will be visible in the "Content" navigation pane
            // of Adobe Acrobat Pro, while editing the .pdf.
            PdfSaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions { ExportDocumentStructure = true };
