In this tutorial, we will explore the provided C# source code to get the theme properties of a document using Aspose.Words for .NET. Theme properties include primary and secondary fonts used, as well as accent colors.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Make sure you have set up your development environment with Aspose.Words for .NET. Make sure you've added the necessary references and imported the appropriate namespaces.

## Step 2: Creating a Document Object

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
```

In this step, we create a new `Document` object.

## Step 3: Get theme properties

```csharp
Aspose.Words.Themes.Theme theme = doc.Theme;

Console.WriteLine(theme.MajorFonts.Latin);
Console.WriteLine(theme.MinorFonts.EastAsian);
Console.WriteLine(theme.Colors.Accent1);
```

In this step, we use the `Theme` property of the `Document` object to get the `Theme` object. Then we can access the different properties of the theme such as the main fonts (`MajorFonts`), the secondary fonts (`MinorFonts`) and the accent colors (`Colors`).

## Step 4: Display theme properties

In this final step, we display the theme property values using `Console.WriteLine`. You can adapt the display according to your needs.

You can run the source code to get the theme properties of a document. This feature allows you to retrieve information about fonts and colors used in a document's theme, which can be useful for style customization or analysis.

### Sample source code for Get Theme Properties using Aspose.Words for .NET

Console.WriteLine(theme.Colors.Accent1);

        
```
