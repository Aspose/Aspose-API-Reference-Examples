In this tutorial, we are going to tell you how to add a new section to a Word document using the Aspose.Words library for .NET. Adding sections helps organize and structure your document more efficiently. We'll take you step-by-step to help you understand and implement the code in your .NET project.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following items:
- A working knowledge of the C# programming language
- The Aspose.Words library for .NET installed in your project

## Step 1: Create a document and constructor
First, we'll create an instance of the `Document` class and an associated `DocumentBuilder` constructor to build the document.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 2: Add content to the document
Next, we'll use the `DocumentBuilder` constructor to add content to the document. In this example, we add two lines of text.

```csharp
builder.Writeln("Hello1");
builder.Writeln("Hello2");
```

## Step 3: Add a new section
To add a new section to the document, we will create an instance of the `Section` class and add it to the `Sections` collection of the document.

```csharp
Section sectionToAdd = new Section(doc);
doc.Sections.Add(sectionToAdd);
```

### Sample source code for Add Section using Aspose.Words for .NET 

```csharp

	Document doc = new Document();
	DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
	builder.Writeln("Hello1");
	builder.Writeln("Hello2");
	Section sectionToAdd = new Section(doc);
	doc.Sections.Add(sectionToAdd);

```
