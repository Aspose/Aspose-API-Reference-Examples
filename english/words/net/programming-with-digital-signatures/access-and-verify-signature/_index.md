In this tutorial, we will guide you through the steps to use the access and signature verification feature of Aspose.Words for .NET. This feature allows you to access digital signatures in a Word document and verify their validity. Follow the steps below:

## Step 1: Loading the document and accessing signatures

Start by uploading the document containing digital signatures:

```csharp
Document doc = new Document("YourPathToTheDocument.docx");
```

## Step 2: Browse Digital Signatures

Use a loop to loop through all the digital signatures in the document:

```csharp
foreach (DigitalSignature signature in doc.DigitalSignatures)
{
	// Access signature information
	Console.WriteLine("*** Signature Found ***");
	Console.WriteLine("Is valid: " + signature.IsValid);
	// This property is available in MS Word documents only.
	Console.WriteLine("Reason for signing: " + signature.Comments); 
	Console.WriteLine("Time of signing: " + signature.SignTime);
	Console.WriteLine("Subject name: " + signature.CertificateHolder.Certificate.SubjectName.Name);
	Console.WriteLine("Issuer name: " + signature.CertificateHolder.Certificate.IssuerName.Name);
	Console.WriteLine();
}
```

Be sure to customize the display messages according to your needs.
