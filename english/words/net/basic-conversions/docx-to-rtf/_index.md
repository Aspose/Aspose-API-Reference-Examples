In this step-by-step tutorial, we will guide you on how to use Aspose.Words for .NET to convert a Word document in Docx format to RTF. We will explain the provided C# source code and show you how to implement it in your own projects.

To get started, ensure that you have Aspose.Words for .NET installed and set up in your development environment. If you haven't done so, download and install the library from the official website.

## Step 1: Reading the Document from Stream

First, open a stream to read the Docx document:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Stream stream = File.OpenRead(MyDir + "Document.docx");
```

## Step 2: Loading the Document

Next, load the document from the stream:

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(stream);
```

## Step 3: Closing the Stream

Since the document is loaded into memory, you can close the stream:

```csharp
stream.Close();
```

## Step 4: Performing Operations on the Document

At this point, you can perform any desired operations on the document.

## Step 5: Saving the Document in RTF Format

To save the document in RTF format, save it to a memory stream:

```csharp
MemoryStream dstStream = new MemoryStream();
doc.Save(dstStream, SaveFormat.Rtf);
```

## Step 6: Rewinding the Stream

Before writing the memory stream to a file, rewind its position back to zero:

```csharp
dstStream.Position = 0;
```

## Step 7: Writing the Stream to File

Finally, write the memory stream to an RTF file:

```csharp
File.WriteAllBytes(dataDir + "BaseConversions.DocxToRtf.rtf", dstStream.ToArray());
```

That's it! You have successfully converted a Word document in Docx format to RTF using Aspose.Words for .NET.

### Example source code for Docx To Rtf using Aspose.Words for .NET

```csharp

	// The path to the documents directory.
	string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
	// Read only access is enough for Aspose.Words to load a document.
	Stream stream = File.OpenRead(MyDir + "Document.docx");

	Document doc = new Document(stream);
	// You can close the stream now, it is no longer needed because the document is in memory.
	stream.Close();

	// ... do something with the document.

	// Convert the document to a different format and save to stream.
	MemoryStream dstStream = new MemoryStream();
	doc.Save(dstStream, SaveFormat.Rtf);

	// Rewind the stream position back to zero so it is ready for the next reader.
	dstStream.Position = 0;

	File.WriteAllBytes(dataDir + "BaseConversions.DocxToRtf.rtf", dstStream.ToArray());
	
```

Feel free to use this code in your own projects and modify it according to your specific requirements.
