In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the step-by-step process to set font folders with priority when rendering a document using Aspose.Words for .NET. We'll explain the bundled C# source code and provide you with a comprehensive guide to help you understand and implement this feature in your own projects. At the end of this tutorial, you will know how to specify multiple font folders with custom search priority when rendering your documents using Aspose.Words for .NET.

## Step 1: Define the document directory
First, you need to set the path to your documents directory. This is the location where you want to save your edited rendered document. Replace "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY" with the appropriate path.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Set font folders with priority
Then you can set the font folders with priority using the `FontSettings` class and the `SetFontsSources()` method. You can specify multiple font sources using instances of `SystemFontSource` and `FolderFontSource`. In this example, we have defined two font sources: the default system font source and a custom font folder with a priority of 1.

```csharp
FontSettings.DefaultInstance.SetFontsSources(new FontSourceBase[]
{
new SystemFontSource(), new FolderFontSource("C:\\MyFonts\\", true, 1)
});
```

## Step 3: Load the document to render
Now you can load the document to render using the `Document` class. Be sure to specify the correct document path.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
```

## Step 4: Save the rendered document
Finally, you can save the rendered document to a file using the `Save()` method of the `Document` class. Be sure to specify the correct path and file name.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFonts.SetFontsFoldersWithPriority.pdf");
```

### Sample source code for Set Fonts Folders With Priority using Aspose.Words for .NET 
```csharp
	// Path to your document directory 
	string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

	FontSettings.DefaultInstance.SetFontsSources(new FontSourceBase[]
	{
		new SystemFontSource(), new FolderFontSource("C:\\MyFonts\\", true,1)
	});
	Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
	doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFonts.SetFontsFoldersWithPriority.pdf");
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to set font folders with priority when rendering a document using Aspose.Words for .NET. By following this step-by-step guide, you can easily specify multiple font folders with custom search priority when rendering your documents.
