In this example, we will explain how to use the indented code feature with Aspose.Words for .NET. Indented code is used to visually represent blocks of code with specific formatting.

## Step 1: Using a document generator

First, we'll use a document generator to add content to our document.

```csharp
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();
```

## Step 2: Add styling for indented code

We will add a custom style for the indented code using the `Styles.Add` method of the `Document` object. In this example, we are creating a style called "IndentedCode" for indented code.

```csharp
Style indentedCode = builder.Document.Styles.Add(StyleType.Paragraph, "IndentedCode");
builder.ParagraphFormat.Style = indentedCode;
```

## Step 3: Add indented code

Now we can add an indented code block using the "IndentedCode" custom style.

```csharp
builder.Writeln("This is an indented code block");
```

### Example source code for indented code with Aspose.Words for .NET

```csharp
	// Use a document builder to add content to the document.
	DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();

	Style indentedCode = builder.Document.Styles.Add(StyleType.Paragraph, "IndentedCode");
	builder.ParagraphFormat.Style = indentedCode;
	builder.Writeln("This is an indented code");
            
```
