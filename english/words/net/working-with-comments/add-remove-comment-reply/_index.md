## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

## Step 1: Load the Document
To start, load the document that contains the comments using the Document class:

```

To remove a reply from the comment, use the RemoveReply method and provide the desired reply index:

```csharp
comment.RemoveReply(comment.Replies[0]);
```

To add a new reply to the comment, use the AddReply method and provide the author name, author initials, date and time, and reply text:

```csharp
comment.AddReply("John Doe", "JD", new DateTime(2017, 9, 25, 12, 15, 0), "New reply");
```

## Step 3: Save the Document
After adding or removing comment replies, save the document to a file using the Save method of the Document class:

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithComments.AddRemoveCommentReply.docx");
```
