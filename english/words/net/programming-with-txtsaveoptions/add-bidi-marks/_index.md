Aspose.Words for .NET is a powerful library for creating, editing, and manipulating Word documents in a C# application. Among the features offered by Aspose.Words is the ability to add Bidi (Bi-directional) marks to a document. In this guide, we will walk you through how to use the C# source code of Aspose.Words for .NET to add Bidi marks to a document.

## Understanding the Aspose.Words library

Before diving into the code, it's important to understand the Aspose.Words library for .NET. Aspose.Words is a popular library that makes working with Word documents easy and efficient. It offers a wide range of features for creating, editing and manipulating Word documents, including adding Bidi marks.

## Creating the document and adding content

The first step is to create a new document and add content to it. Use the Document class to create a new document instance. Then use the DocumentBuilder class to add text to the document. Here is an example :

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

builder. Writen("Hello world!");
builder.ParagraphFormat.Bidi = true;
builder. Writen("שלום עולם!");
builder. Writen("مرحبا بالعالم!");
```

In this example, we create a new document and use the DocumentBuilder to add text. We've added three lines of text: one in English, one in Hebrew, and one in Arabic to demonstrate adding content in different languages.

## Added Bidi marks

Once the content has been added, we can now add Bidi marks to the document. For this, we use the TxtSaveOptions class and we set the AddBidiMarks property to true. Here's how:

```csharp
TxtSaveOptions saveOptions = new TxtSaveOptions { AddBidiMarks = true };
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithTxtSaveOptions.AddBidiMarks.txt", saveOptions);
```

In this example, we create an instance of TxtSaveOptions and set the AddBidiMarks property to true. Next, we use the Save method of the Document class to save the document with Bidi marks.

### Example source code for "Add Bidi Marks" functionality with Aspose.Words for .NET

```csharp
// Path to your documents directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

// Create the document and add content
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

builder. Writen("Hello world!");
builder.ParagraphFormat.Bidi = true;
builder. Writen("שלום עולם!");
builder. Writen("مرحبا بالعالم!");

// Add Bidi marks
TxtSaveOptions saveOptions = new TxtSaveOptions { AddBidiMarks = true

  };
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithTxtSaveOptions.AddBidiMarks.txt", saveOptions);
```
