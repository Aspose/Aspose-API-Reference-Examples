In this example, we are going to tell you how to bold text with Aspose.Words for .NET. Bolding text makes it more visible and gives it more prominence.

## Step 1: Using a document generator

First, we'll use a document generator to add content to our document.

We can bold the text by setting the document builder's `Font.Bold` property to `true`.

```csharp
builder.Font.Bold = true;
```

```csharp
builder.Writeln("This text will be bold");
```
