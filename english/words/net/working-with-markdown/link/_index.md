In this example, we will walk you through how to use the links feature with Aspose.Words for .NET. Links are used to create clickable references to websites or other documents.

## Step 1: Using a document generator

First, we'll use a document generator to add content to our document.

```csharp
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();
```

## Step 2: Inserting a link

We can insert a link using the `Insertlink` method of the document generator. We need to specify the link text, here "Aspose", as well as the destination URL.

```csharp
builder.Insertlink("Aspose", "https://www.aspose.com", false);
```
