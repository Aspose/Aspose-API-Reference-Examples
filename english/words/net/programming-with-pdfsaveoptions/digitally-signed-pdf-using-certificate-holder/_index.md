In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the steps to create a digitally signed PDF using a certificate with Aspose.Words for .NET. The digital signature adds a layer of security and integrity to the PDF document. Follow the steps below:

## Step 1: Creating the document and adding content

Start by creating an instance of the Document class:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 2: Add content to the document

Then use the `DocumentBuilder` to add content to the document. For example, to add a paragraph containing the text "Test Signed PDF", use the `Writeln` method:

```csharp
builder.Writeln("Test Signed PDF.");
```

You can add other content items as needed.

## Step 3: Set PDF save options

Create an instance of the PdfSaveOptions class and specify the digital signature details:

```csharp
PdfSaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions
{
	DigitalSignatureDetails = new PdfDigitalSignatureDetails(
		CertificateHolder.Create(MyDir + "morzal.pfx", "aw"), "reason", "location",
		DateTime.Now)
};
```

Be sure to specify the correct path to your certificate and associated password. You can also customize the signature reason and location.

## Step 4: Save Document as Digitally Signed PDF

Use the `Save` method to save the document as a PDF by specifying the save options:

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithPdfSaveOptions.DigitallySignedPdfUsingCertificateHolder.pdf", saveOptions);
```

Make sure to specify the correct path to save the digitally signed PDF.

By following these steps, you can easily create a digitally signed PDF with a certificate using Aspose.Words for .NET.
