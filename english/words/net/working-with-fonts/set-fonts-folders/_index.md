In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the step-by-step process to set font folders when rendering a document using Aspose.Words for .NET. We'll explain the bundled C# source code and provide you with a comprehensive guide to help you understand and implement this feature in your own projects. By the end of this tutorial, you will know how to specify the font folders to use when rendering your documents using Aspose.Words for .NET.

## Step 1: Define the document directory
First, you need to set the path to your documents directory. This is the location where you want to save your edited rendered document. Replace "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY" with the appropriate path.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Set Font Sources
Then you can set the font sources using the `FontSettings.DefaultInstance` class and the `SetFontsSources()` method. In this example, we are using both a system font source and a custom folder font source. Be sure to adjust the path to the custom fonts folder according to your needs.

```csharp
FontSettings.DefaultInstance.SetFontsSources(new FontSourceBase[]
{
new SystemFontSource(),
new FolderFontSource("C:\\MyFonts\\", true)
});
```

## Step 3: Load the document to render
Now you can load the document to render using the `Document` class. Be sure to specify the correct document path.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
```

## Step 4: Save the rendered document
Finally, you can save the rendered document to a file using the `Save()` method of the `Document` class. Be sure to specify the correct path and file name.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFonts.SetFontsFolders.pdf");
```

### Sample source code for Set Fonts Folders using Aspose.Words for .NET

	});
	Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
	doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithFonts.SetFontsFolders.pdf");
```
