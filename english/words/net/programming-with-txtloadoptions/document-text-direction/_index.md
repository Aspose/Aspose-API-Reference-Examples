In this tutorial, we will explore the C# source code provided for the "Document Text Direction" feature with Aspose.Words for .NET. This feature lets you specify the direction of text in a document, which is especially useful for languages that are written from right to left, such as Hebrew or Arabic.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Before you begin, make sure you've set up your development environment with Aspose.Words for .NET. Make sure you've added the necessary references and imported the appropriate namespaces.

## Step 2: Configuring upload options

```csharp
// Path to your documents directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

TxtLoadOptions loadOptions = new TxtLoadOptions { DocumentDirection = DocumentDirection. Auto };
```

In this step, we configure the document loading options. We create a new `TxtLoadOptions` object and set the `DocumentDirection` property to `DocumentDirection.Auto`. This value tells Aspose.Words to automatically determine the text direction based on the content of the document.

## Step 3: Loading the document

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Hebrew text.txt", loadOptions);
```

In this step, we load the document using the `Document` method and passing the path to the text file to load. We also use the specified loading options.

## Step 4: Manipulate the paragraph and display the text direction

```csharp
Paragraph paragraph = doc.FirstSection.Body.FirstParagraph;
Console.WriteLine(paragraph.ParagraphFormat.Bidi);
```

In this step, we access the first paragraph of the document using the `FirstSection` and `Body` properties. Next, we access the `ParagraphFormat.Bidi` property to get the text direction of the paragraph. We then display this value in the console.

## Step 5: Save the document

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithTxtLoadOptions.DocumentTextDirection.docx");
```

In this last step, we save the resulting document in .docx format using the `Save` method and passing the path to the output file.

Now you can run the source code to load the text document and determine the text direction. The resulting document will be saved in the specified directory with the name "WorkingWithTxtLoadOptions.DocumentTextDirection.docx".

### Sample source code for document text direction functionality with Aspose.Words for .NET.


```csharp

            
// Path to your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

TxtLoadOptions loadOptions = new TxtLoadOptions { DocumentDirection = DocumentDirection.Auto };

Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Hebrew text.txt", loadOptions);

Paragraph paragraph = doc.FirstSection.Body.FirstParagraph;
Console.WriteLine(paragraph.ParagraphFormat.Bidi);

doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithTxtLoadOptions.DocumentTextDirection.docx");
            
        
```
