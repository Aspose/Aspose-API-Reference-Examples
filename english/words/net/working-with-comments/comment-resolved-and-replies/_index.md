In this comprehensive tutorial, you will learn how to resolve comments and their replies in a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET. We will guide you through the process and provide you with the necessary C# code snippets. By the end of this guide, you will be able to manage comment resolution and update the status of comments and their replies.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- Aspose.Words for .NET library installed on your system.

## Step 1: Load the Document and Access Comments
To start, load the document that contains the comments using the Document class and access the comments collection:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Comments.docx");

NodeCollection comments = doc.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Comment, true);
```

## Step 2: Resolve Comments and Their Replies
Next, iterate through the comments and their replies to mark them as resolved:

```csharp
Comment parentComment = (Comment)comments[0];

foreach (Comment childComment in parentComment.Replies)
{
    Console.WriteLine(childComment.Ancestor.Id);
    Console.WriteLine(childComment.Done);

    childComment.Done = true;
}
```

In the above code, we access the parent comment and iterate through its replies. We can retrieve the parent comment ID and its resolution status. Then, we update the "Done" mark of each comment reply to indicate resolution.

## Step 3: Save the Document
After resolving the comments and updating their status, save the modified document to a file using the Save method of the Document class:

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithComments.CommentResolvedAndReplies.docx");
```

### Example Source Code for Resolving Comments and Their Replies using Aspose.Words for .NET
Here is the complete source code for resolving comments and their replies using Aspose.Words for .NET:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Comments.docx");

NodeCollection comments = doc.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Comment, true);

Comment parentComment = (Comment)comments[0];

foreach (Comment childComment in parentComment.Replies)
{
    Console.WriteLine(childComment.Ancestor.Id);
    Console.WriteLine(childComment.Done);

    childComment.Done = true;
}

doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithComments.CommentResolvedAndReplies.docx");
```
Remember to adjust the code according to your specific requirements, including the document file path and additional customization

## Conclusion
