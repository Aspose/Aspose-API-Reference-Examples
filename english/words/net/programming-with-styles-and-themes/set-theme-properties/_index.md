In this tutorial, we will explore the provided C# source code to set the theme properties of a document using Aspose.Words for .NET. We are going to change the secondary fonts and theme colors.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Make sure you have set up your development environment with Aspose.Words for .NET. Make sure you've added the necessary references and imported the appropriate namespaces.

## Step 2: Creating a Document Object

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
```

In this step, we create a new `Document` object.

## Step 3: Edit theme properties

```csharp
Aspose.Words.Themes.Theme theme = doc.Theme;
theme.MinorFonts.Latin = "Times New Roman";
theme.Colors.Hyperlink = Color.Gold;
```

In this step, we access the `Theme` object of the `Document` object to get the document theme. Next, we can modify theme properties such as secondary fonts (`MinorFonts.Latin`) and colors (`Colors.Hyperlink`).

## Step 4: Save the document

In this last step, you can save the modified document as needed.

You can run source code to set theme properties for a document. This lets you customize the fonts and colors used in the theme to achieve a consistent look across your documents.

### Sample source code for Set Theme Properties using Aspose.Words for .NET

```
