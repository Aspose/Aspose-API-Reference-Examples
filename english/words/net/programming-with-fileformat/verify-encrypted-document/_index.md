This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the Encrypted Document Verification feature with Aspose.Words for .NET. We will explain each part of the code in detail. At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to understand how to check if a document is encrypted.

Before you start, make sure you have installed and configured the Aspose.Words for .NET library in your project. You can find the library and installation instructions on the Aspose website.

## Step 1: Define the document directory

To start, you need to define the path to the directory where your documents are located. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your documents directory.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Detect file format

Next, we use the `DetectFileFormat` method of the `FileFormatUtil` class to detect the file format information. In this example, we assume that the encrypted document is called "Encrypted.docx" and is located in the specified documents directory.

```csharp
FileFormatInfo info = FileFormatUtil.DetectFileFormat(dataDir + "Encrypted.docx");
```

## Step 3: Check if the document is encrypted

We use the `IsEncrypted` property of the `FileFormatInfo` object to check if the document is encrypted. This property returns `true` if the document is encrypted, otherwise it returns `false`. We display the result in the console.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(info.IsEncrypted);
```

That's all ! You have successfully checked if a document is encrypted using Aspose.Words for .NET.

### Example source code for verifying encrypted documents with Aspose.Words for .NET

```csharp

	// The path to the documents directory.
	string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
	FileFormatInfo info = FileFormatUtil.DetectFileFormat(dataDir + "Encrypted.docx");
	Console.WriteLine(info.IsEncrypted);
            
        
```
