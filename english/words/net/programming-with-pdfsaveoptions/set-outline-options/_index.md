This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the set outline options to metafile size feature with Aspose.Words for .NET. We will explain each part of the code in detail. At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to understand how to set outline options in a document and generate a PDF with the corresponding outline options.

Before you start, make sure you have installed and configured the Aspose.Words for .NET library in your project. You can find the library and installation instructions on the Aspose website.

## Step 1: Define the document directory

To start, you need to define the path to the directory where your documents are located. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your documents directory.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Upload the document

Next, we need to load the document we want to process. In this example, we assume the document is called "Rendering.docx" and is located in the specified documents directory.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Rendering.docx");
```

## Step 3: Configure save as PDF options with plan options

To set outline options in the generated PDF, we need to configure the `PdfSaveOptions` object. We can set the number of heading outline levels (`HeadingsOutlineLevels`) and the number of expanded outline levels (`ExpandedOutlineLevels`).

```csharp
PdfSaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions();
saveOptions.OutlineOptions.HeadingsOutlineLevels = 3;
saveOptions.OutlineOptions.ExpandedOutlineLevels = 1;
```

## Step 4: Save document as PDF with outline options

Finally, we can save the document in PDF format using the save options configured previously.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithPdfSaveOptions.SetOutlineOptions.pdf", saveOptions);
```

That's all ! You have successfully set outline options in a document and generated a PDF with corresponding outline options using Aspose.Words for .NET.
