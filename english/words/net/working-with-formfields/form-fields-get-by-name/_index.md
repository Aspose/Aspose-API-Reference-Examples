In this step-by-step tutorial, we will guide you on how to use Aspose.Words for .NET to retrieve form fields by name from a Word document. We will explain the provided C# source code and show you how to implement it in your own projects.

To get started, make sure you have Aspose.Words for .NET installed and set up in your development environment. If you haven't done so, download and install the library from the official website.

## Step 1: Initializing the Document Object

First, initialize the `Document` object by providing the path to your source document containing form fields:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";        
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Form fields.docx");
```

## Step 2: Retrieving Form Fields

Next, access the `FormFields` property of the `Range` object in the document to retrieve all the form fields:

```csharp
FormFieldCollection documentFormFields = doc.Range.FormFields;
```

You can retrieve form fields either by index or by name. In this example, we retrieve a form field using both methods:

```csharp
FormField formField1 = documentFormFields[3]; // Retrieving by index
FormField formField2 = documentFormFields["Text2"]; // Retrieving by name
```

## Step 3: Modifying Form Field Properties

Once you have retrieved the form fields, you can modify their properties as needed. In this example, we change the font size of `formField1` to 20 and the font color of `formField2` to red:

```csharp
formField1.Font.Size = 20;
formField2.Font.Color = Color.Red;
```

## Step 4: Saving the Document

Finally, save the modified document:

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "ModifiedFormFields.docx");
```

That's it! You have successfully retrieved form fields by name and modified their properties in a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET.

### Example source code for Form Fields Get By Name using Aspose.Words for .NET

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";        
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Form fields.docx");

FormFieldCollection documentFormFields = doc.Range.FormFields;

FormField formField1 = documentFormFields[3];
FormField formField2 = documentFormFields["Text2"];

formField1.Font.Size = 20;
formField2.Font.Color = Color.Red;

doc.Save(dataDir + "ModifiedFormFields.docx");
```

Feel free to use this code in your own projects and modify it according to your specific requirements.
