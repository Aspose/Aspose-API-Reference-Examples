In this comprehensive tutorial, you will learn how to add comments to a Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET. We will guide you through the process and provide you with the necessary C# code snippets. By the end of this guide, you will be able to insert comments and customize their content in your documents.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- Aspose.Words for .NET library installed on your system.

## Step 1: Create a New Document and DocumentBuilder
To start, create a new document using the Document class and initialize a DocumentBuilder object:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
```

## Step 2: Add Content to the Document
Next, add the desired content to the document using the DocumentBuilder object. In this example, we add some text:

```csharp
builder.Write("Some text is added.");
```

## Step 3: Create a Comment and Add Contents
To add a comment, create an instance of the Comment class, passing the Document object, author name, author initials, and the current date:

```csharp
Comment comment = new Comment(doc, "Awais Hafeez", "AH", DateTime.Today);
```

Next, append the comment to the current paragraph:

```csharp
builder.CurrentParagraph.AppendChild(comment);
```

Add contents to the comment, such as a paragraph and text:

```csharp
comment.Paragraphs.Add(new Paragraph(doc));
comment.FirstParagraph.Runs.Add(new Run(doc, "Comment text."));
```

## Step 4: Save the Document
After adding the comment and its contents, save the document to a file using the Save method of the Document class:

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "WorkingWithComments.AddComments.docx");
```
